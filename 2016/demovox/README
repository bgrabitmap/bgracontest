Introduction
============

  A graphical demo for Lazarus/FPC.  For more info, visit and read:
  http://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php/topic,32626.0.html

  This is a very simple voxel renderer.  You'll need Allegro 5.2.  It isn't
  included in the package because it is quite big.  You can get it from
  http://liballeg.org/.  You can get Allegro.pas from
  http://allegro-pas.sf.net/.  Note that Allegro.pas is in alpha status
  yet.

===========
Compilation
===========

  There's a project for Lazarus (voxel.lpi).  It should do the work.  Note
  that it has optimization activated and doesn't include debug info.

  Open a console and go to the project directory.  In most cases just use
  "cd project".

  Execute "fix.bat" on Windows or "./fix.sh" on GNU/Linux and follow the
  on screen instructions.

  Execute the "make" command.  This should create the executable files.
  If you have problems read the "Contact info" section.

  Execute "make help" to see all available options.  You can also edit
  makefile to change the compilation options.


==========
How to use
==========

  Just execute it.  Use WASD, cursors and mouse to move around.  Shift key
  modifies height, and F12 takes a shoot (note: it will overwrite the
  previous one!).

  You can pass two picture files in command line.  For example:

  #./voxel height-2.pcx ground.pcx

  First is the heightmap and second are the colors.  See the examples
  provided.
